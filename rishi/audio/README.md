# Audio Files

This directory contains placeholder files for the Rishi Rhythm app. Replace these with actual audio files:

## Structure:

- `/shuddh/` - Contains mantra pronunciation files (mantra01.mp3 through mantra50.mp3)
- `/ambience/` - Contains ambient sounds like tanpura_drone.mp3
- `brahma_chime.mp3` - Brahma Muhurta notification chime

## Note:
The current files are placeholder. For a complete application, replace with:
- High-quality Sanskrit mantra recordings with proper pronunciation
- Tanpura drone for ambient background
- A gentle chime sound for Brahma Muhurta notifications
